These manually labeled scans, which can be found at the [CT-CLIP repository](https://github.com/ibrahimethemhamamci/CT-CLIP/tree/main/text_classifier/data), are treated as a gold standard for evaluation.\n",

The original train/validation split provided with the CT-RATE dataset on Hugging Face is ignored. Instead, this repository provides a `FILTERED_MASTER_LIST.csv`. This approach offers two main advantages:\n",
